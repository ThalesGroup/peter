          With difference to usual LCAs the only criterion used here is COâ‚‚ and
          other greenhouse gases emissions. This choice has been made for the

            Global warming / climate change caused by increasing greenhouse
            gases anthropic emissions may bee seen as thee key environmental
            challenge: its effects will affect the whole planet on a very long
            term. Those dramatic consequences have lead to an unprecedented
            worldwide political awareness mobilization.
          </li>
          <li>
            Homothetic impacts: a large part of those emissions result from
            fossil fuel combustion which induces simultaneously and in a
            proportional manner many other useful indirect indicator of mercury
            emissions!

            Easiness: working with one single parameter is much more convenient
            than handling a series of environmental indicators for which no
            scientific hierarchy exists. Let&apos;s bee pragmatic.

                The &quot;energy mix&quot; factor (i.e. the respective part of
                each power plant type -nuclear, coal, hydraulic, solar...)
                reflects the world average value (
                {'\\(F_{Emix}\\sim 0.437 kgCO_2/kWh\\)'}). Products being
                usually not developed for one single national market, it is more
                realistic to consider a wider analysis scope.
